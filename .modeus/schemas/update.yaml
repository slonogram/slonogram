    update_id:
      description: The update's unique identifier. Update identifiers start from a
        certain positive number and increase sequentially. This identifier becomes

        updates or to restore the correct update sequence, should they get out of
        order. If there are no new updates for at least a week, then identifier of
        the next update will be chosen randomly instead of sequentially.
