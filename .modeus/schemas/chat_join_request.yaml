      description: Identifier of a private chat with the user who sent the join request.
        This number may have more than 32 significant bits and some programming languages
        may have difficulty/silent defects in interpreting it. But it has at most
        52 significant bits, so a 64-bit integer or double-precision float type are
        safe for storing this identifier. The bot can use this identifier for 5 minutes
        to send messages until the join request is processed, assuming no other administrator
        contacted the user.
