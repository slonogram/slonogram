    via the link https://api.telegram.org/file/bot<token>/<file_path>. It is guaranteed
    that the link will be valid for at least 1 hour. When the link expires, a new
    one can be requested by calling getFile.
  fields:
    file_id:
      description: Identifier for this file, which can be used to download or reuse
        the file
      required: true
      types:
      - String

    file_size:
      description: Optional. File size in bytes. It can be bigger than 2^31 and some
        programming languages may have difficulty/silent defects in interpreting it.
        But it has at most 52 significant bits, so a signed 64-bit integer or double-precision
        float type are safe for storing this value.
