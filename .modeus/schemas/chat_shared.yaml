        description: Identifier of the shared chat. This number may have more than
          32 significant bits and some programming languages may have difficulty/silent
          defects in interpreting it. But it has at most 52 significant bits, so a
          64-bit integer or double-precision float type are safe for storing this
          identifier. The bot may not have access to the chat and could be unable
          to use this identifier, unless the chat is already known to the bot by some
          other means.
