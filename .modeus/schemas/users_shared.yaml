          than 32 significant bits and some programming languages may have difficulty/silent
          defects in interpreting them. But they have at most 52 significant bits,
          so 64-bit integers or double-precision float types are safe for storing
          these identifiers. The bot may not have access to the users and could be
          unable to use these identifiers, unless the users are already known to the
          bot by some other means.
