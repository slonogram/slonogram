        description: Optional. The group has been migrated to a supergroup with the
          specified identifier. This number may have more than 32 significant bits
          and some programming languages may have difficulty/silent defects in interpreting
          it. But it has at most 52 significant bits, so a signed 64-bit integer or
          double-precision float type are safe for storing this identifier.
