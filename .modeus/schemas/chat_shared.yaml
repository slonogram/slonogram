data:
  description:
  - This object contains information about the chat whose identifier was shared with
    the bot using a KeyboardButtonRequestChat button.
  fields:
    request_id:
      description: Identifier of the request
      required: true
      types:
      - Integer
    chat_id:
      description: Identifier of the shared chat. This number may have more than 32
        significant bits and some programming languages may have difficulty/silent
        defects in interpreting it. But it has at most 52 significant bits, so a 64-bit
        integer or double-precision float type are safe for storing this identifier.
        The bot may not have access to the chat and could be unable to use this identifier,
        unless the chat is already known to the bot by some other means.
      required: true
