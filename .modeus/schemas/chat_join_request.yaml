      user_chat_id:
        description: Identifier of a private chat with the user who sent the join
          request. This number may have more than 32 significant bits and some programming
          languages may have difficulty/silent defects in interpreting it. But it
          has at most 52 significant bits, so a 64-bit integer or double-precision
          float type are safe for storing this identifier. The bot can use this identifier
          for 5 minutes to send messages until the join request is processed, assuming
          no other administrator contacted the user.
