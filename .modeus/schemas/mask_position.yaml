data:
  description:
  - This object describes the position on faces where a mask should be placed by default.
  fields:

      description: The part of the face relative to which the mask should be placed.
        One of "forehead", "eyes", "mouth", or "chin".
      required: true
      types:
      - String
    x_shift:
      description: Shift by X-axis measured in widths of the mask scaled to the face
        size, from left to right. For example, choosing -1.0 will place mask just
        to the left of the default mask position.
      required: true
      types:
      - Float
    y_shift:
      description: Shift by Y-axis measured in heights of the mask scaled to the face
        size, from top to bottom. For example, 1.0 will place the mask just below
        the default mask position.
      required: true
      types:
      - Float
    scale:
      description: Mask scaling coefficient. For example, 2.0 means double size.
      required: true
