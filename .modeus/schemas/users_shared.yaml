data:
  description:
  - This object contains information about the users whose identifiers were shared
    with the bot using a KeyboardButtonRequestUsers button.
  fields:
    request_id:
      description: Identifier of the request
      required: true
      types:
      - Integer
    user_ids:
      description: Identifiers of the shared users. These numbers may have more than
        32 significant bits and some programming languages may have difficulty/silent
        defects in interpreting them. But they have at most 52 significant bits, so
        64-bit integers or double-precision float types are safe for storing these
        identifiers. The bot may not have access to the users and could be unable
        to use these identifiers, unless the users are already known to the bot by
        some other means.
      required: true
      types:
      - Array of Integer
